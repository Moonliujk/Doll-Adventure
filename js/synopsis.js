    Dear Warrior, I am a <span class="empersized">handsome game developer</span> and am happy to communicate with you via this email,
which connects to the virtual world. In the virtual world I created, the beautiful princess <img src="images/princess show.png">was kidnapped by a gang of evil computer bugs! (excited?! Ha),
and I hope you can use your excellent operation to rescued the Princess (in accordance with the previous plot development, you could marry her after she was rescued, surprised? Haha!).
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to help you get rid of the "single dog" title (maybe you are not,
      but you can keep a mistress in a love nest? Kidding), there is a simple game introduction for you. Please do not thanks me, that’s my pleasure.
      (You can chat with me privately about the price, <span class="empersized">and Bitcoin is also OK!</span>)：
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You could control the doll’ movement using ‘up, down, left, right’ in keyboard!</li>

    <li>You should pass through the dangerous grass and reach the river to pass the level.</li>
  </ul>`,
  `
  <ul>
    <li>Please care about those stupid bugs when crossing grass. Through those bugs are really
        cute,<img src="images/enemy-bug show.png" alt="bug" />, don’t be deceived by their beautiful appearance.
        You could lose 1 HP when meeting with them, and make you come back the initial location.
    </li>

    <li>You have 5 HP at the beginning of the game and should pass all 10 levels before all 5 HP lost.
        (Warning: You couldn’t recover your life after passing level. The only way that will recover your life is to get blood bags).
        Good luck, my dear friend.
    </li>

    <li>There are rocks <img src="images/Rock show.png" alt="block" /> which could block you to cross them.
        (I don’t admit I just want to test you!)
    </li>
  </ul>`,

  `
  <ul>

    <li>There are some stuff which could make the game more fun. You could get lots of score when you get gems with various color.
        Green gems <img src="images/Gem Green show.png" alt="gems" />are very normal, and you could get 30 score when getting it.
        Blue gems <img src="images/Gem Blue show.png" alt="gems" /> are rare, and the score is 60.
        Yellow one <img src="images/Gem Orange show.png" alt="gems" /> is the most rare gem, and its score is 80.
    </li>

    <li>What? You ask me what I can do with score? Emmmm~~ I just want to ask you
        whether you have played game. The more score you get, the better rank number you can achieve.</li>

    <li>I know that you will lost your lift. So, just I said before, you could
        recover your life through getting blood bags <img src="images/Heart_show.png" alt="heart" />.
        You could have no more than 5 HP, and other blood bags will make you get score (one blood bags is equal to 100 score).
    </li>

  </ul>`,

  `
  <ul>
    <li>Maybe there are keys <img src="images/Key show.png" alt="key" /> on the land and you can get it.
        After you get key, the star treasure <img src="images/Star show.png" alt="start" /> will show on the land.
        Of course, you can get it, and that could help you unclose a new doll (You could choose and use the new doll in the ‘Start-interface’)!
        Oh, the scores of treasure and key are both 50 score.
    </li>

    <li>And the last one, the game will become more difficult with the increase of level.
        Those bugs will become more excited than before. (Emmm~~ If you are a bug,
          you could also become anxious because you don’t want the beautiful princess being taken away) <img src="images/princess help show.png" alt="princess" />.
          You could find there are more and more bugs and in the map their speed is faster than before. It's time to test your game skill.
    </li>
  </ul> `,

 `
  <ul>

    <li>By the way, to help you pass the level, I will use my magic to create an unstable portal <img src="images/Selector show.png" alt="portal" />on the land (What?).
        You could be transmitted the random location in the map when you located on it…… Be careful,
        because my magic power is not enough (that’s why call portal unstable),
        you could have big opportunity to meet with those bugs after the transition is over (I am so sorry about that).
        But…but, maybe the portal will help you in crisis time, won’t it? (I have to admit the probability is low~~~)
    </li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    Good luck, warrior, I will bless you can passing all levels at one time (Please don’t care about it. I just mouthed some platitudes.
    If you pass all level at one time, I will shame about myself).
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I will wait for you coming again princess side.</span>(Some things are wrong. Doesn’t matter!)
    The dawn of victory is coming.
